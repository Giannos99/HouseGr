        <h1>Welcome to the HouseGr.</h1>
        

            


<p>HouseGr is an independent, family-run estate agency, dedicated to providing a highly personal, professional & friendly service, drawing on more than 10 years experience in the Greek property market.

We believe there is no substitute for experience, and our many years of work in the local market ensures a service which is second to none.

Our aim is to offer you, our customers, the best possible service and good value for money.

We offer you the way to find your ideal home, a quick and reliable way to rent or sell

an existing house.</p>

<p>We drive you round as many properties and villages as you wish, giving you information on the properties, as well as on the area they are placed in.

Not only do we help you choose your "dream-property" or sell/rent your existing one,but also we assist you with all the legal matters and purchasing procedure, help you open a bank account, but we can also offer you advice on any other matter such as health and house insurance, transportation of your furniture (companies and legal advice), best shops, restaurants, and the "know how" of the area you wish to purchase a property.

We can also introduce you to some excellent  architects, who have their own crews of builders, plumbers, electricians, etc, and who have the experience of restoring old stone houses to their former glory, or building new houses for you.

We can introduce you to lawyers that can help you through the purchasing procedure, in fact you have to do nothing, they do it all.

This means that the property can be signed over to you, or rent/ sell it in your absence and it is not necessary for you to be present.

Your lawyer will draw a deposit agreement between you and the vendor.

He/she will arrange everything else, Greek Inland Revenue, Public Notary, Registry Office etc on your behalf.</p>

<p>
There are a great number of highly satisfied clients who will be more than willing to share with you their experience of buying through our company or their building or renovating experience. 
Their e-mail addresses or telephone numbers are available upon request.

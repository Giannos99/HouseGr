This is a fully functional site, created using html, css, javascript,
java server pages, relational database , jquery, lightbox for picture slide show,
and google maps api.

The concept of the site was to create an online platform in which, a person
could register his house, for sale or rent, while others could show interest
to it, by emailing to that person, or sending him an inbox message.

A person who wishes to rent or sell his/her house, should first register to
our database as a seller (to sell) or landlord (to rent) or both.
After that, he can write the location of the house on the register a house 
platform, and it automatically locates it on the google map, or he can just
click on the map to add it as well.

Every house has its own profile page, where you can see info and pictures about
it.If you are the house owner you can configure this info, and upload/delete
pictures.

Additionally, when a seller/landlord logs in, the map displays clickable icons
for the houses he/she has already registered to our database.

Now, a person who wishes to buy, or rent a house, he or she, can enter in 
a search platform his/hers personal preferences and search for it.
In order to contact the seller/landlord, one has to register to our platform
firstly.

The search is being made with two differnet algorithms.
Simple Additive Weight (SAW) algorithm  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_sum_model
and 
TOPSIS algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPSIS
